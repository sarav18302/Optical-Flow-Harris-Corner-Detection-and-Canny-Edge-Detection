# Optical Flow, Harris Corner Detection, and Canny Edge Detection Project Documentation

This repository implements computer vision algorithms, including Optical Flow, Harris Corner Detection, and Canny Edge Detection. It uses Jupyter Notebooks for experimentation and analysis, targeting image processing and feature detection tasks. The project demonstrates the application of fundamental vision techniques for motion estimation and edge/corner identification.

## Overview

This project focuses on implementing and demonstrating three key computer vision algorithms: Optical Flow, Harris Corner Detection, and Canny Edge Detection. These algorithms are widely used for motion tracking, feature detection, and edge detection in images. The repository is designed for research, experimentation, and educational purposes, providing modular implementations in Jupyter Notebooks. 

Goals include: 
- Showcasing algorithmic principles through clear Python implementations.
- Enabling reproducibility and experimentation via Jupyter Notebooks.
- Facilitating modifications for domain-specific adaptations.
Rationale: dividing the project into independent modules ensures modularity, allowing developers to focus on specific algorithms or integrate them into larger pipelines. The repository adopts a procedural approach, prioritizing clarity and reusability.



## Key Features

This project provides the following features:
- Optical Flow computation using the Lucas-Kanade method for motion estimation.
